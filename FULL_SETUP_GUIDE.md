## 🔑 Step 2: Get Your AI API Keys (3 minutes)
The system uses "AI Brains" to read and understand resumes.

   - Sign in or create an account.
   - Go to the **API Keys** section.
   - Click **"Create new secret key"**, name it "My Hiring App", and **copy the key immediately**.
   - **Note:** You need a small amount of credit (e.g., $5) in your OpenAI billing account for the key to work.
2. **Hugging Face Token (Optional - for visual scanning):**
   - Go to [Hugging Face Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
   - Create a "Read" token and copy it.

## 🆘 Common Issues (Troubleshooting)
- **"Python is not recognized":** You didn't check "Add to PATH" in Step 1. Please re-install Python.
- **"Redirect URI Mismatch":** Ensure the URL in Step 3D matches exactly where you are running the app.
- **"Missing Scope Error":** You forgot to check the "Send" box in Step 6. Click "Disconnect" on the dashboard and try Step 6 again.
- **"No OpenAI Key Found":** Ensure your `.env` file is named correctly and has the `OPENAI_API_KEY` inside.
